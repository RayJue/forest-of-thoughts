# Projects in the Tree of Thoughts Ecosystem
Projects that use Tree of Thoughts to increase reasoning!

## The Compiler
A novel child project under the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) paradigm. This project is crafted with the intent of making autonomous programming not just a reality, but an effortless task for you.

In essence, The Compiler allows you to "grow" any program you can dream of. By providing a high-level specification of the product you would like, you can sit back and let The Compiler do the heavy lifting.

## Meta TOT - Meta Tree of Thoughts

Meta TOT (Meta Tree of Thoughts) aims to enhance the Tree of Thoughts (TOT) language algorithm by using a secondary agent to critique and improve the primary agent's prompts. This innovative approach allows the primary agent to generate more accurate and relevant responses based on the feedback from the secondary agent.
